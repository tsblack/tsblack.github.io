Let's give this another go...

No Wordpress, no Linux. This version makes use of Github pages - no admin to worry about, w00t.

Lots of awesome new tech I've been meaning to play with:

Jekyll
Bootstrap
More Git
Ruby (testing Octopress for automation)

More tech, more tech. After spending many, many years directing, and now consulting on, tech projects, 
I thought it's about time I directed some of this enthusiasm to personal projects.
