Let's give this another go... 

My last attempt at maintaining an active blog
made use of Wordpress on a Linux VPS kindly sponsored by my friend Eric Andrews
over at [Compile Consulting](http://www.compile.co.za). Fun at the time, but
I definitely no longer have a desire to maintain Internet facing instances,
especially not running Wordpress.

This version makes use of Github pages - no Linux, no Wordpress, no admin; w00t!

It includes loads of awesome new tech I've been meaning to play with though:

* Jekyll
* Bootstrap
* More Git
* Ruby (testing Octopress for automation)

I plan on spending more time with personal tech. After spending many years directing, 
and now consulting on tech projects, I thought it's about time I directed some of 
this enthusiam into personal efforts.
